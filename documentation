Syntax is the following:

If an empty JSON string is supplied then return all the data
json string is sentas {data:[], Limit, }
return whatever limit is


supply an appid to get information for that application, add parameters to pull the information about that application

If you want data that doesn't really pertain to a specific application then you just put in the fields you want without an ID

If you want comparative data then just add it to id's array and it will pull that information for the arrays
